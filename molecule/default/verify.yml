# WARNING: READ THIS if you are running port checks
# If we want to get the "listening ports", then assuming we are using a docker container to test, then we need to run
# "netstat" on localhost, and not in the container. This is because the container we're testing the role in is interfacing with the docker instance it
# itself is running in. Therefore the testing container has a SIBLING relationship with the containers it stands up, and not a parent / child relationship
# as such, its impossible (?) to get the listening ports of the "host" from within the testing container, so this must be run on localhost, and those
# results checked
# WARNING 2: READ THIS is you are running port checks
# It also assumes that the user you are running as has sudo permissions on netstat, so we can get the prog that is listening, without that, we'll only know
# if the port is open or not. Further, if testing within docker, then the listening process will always be docker-prox (or whatever the docker proxy binary is)
# undoubtedly, this would be better on a vm than a container

# Add role specific tests here
